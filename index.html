Not knowing whether or not we were on a date. What an incredible rush it was when I learned that we were. Imagine winning the lottery and then multiply that by infinity. Truly the most exhilarating moment of my life.</p>

                        <p>This song on its own is beautiful and, of course, the words are perfectly representative of how I feel about you. But that’s not exactly why I chose it.
                        <br><br>A large reason why I watch this show is that its premise has always mirrored my desire to find “The One”, as well as the ups and downs of grappling with whether or not that “One” even existed. But the scene where this song plays has always hit me the hardest because it perfectly encapsulates that desire + longing in the moment just before they both find each other.
                        <br><br>That scene, and this song, always kept me believing that I would one day find you. And now when I hear it, I’m filled with overwhelming gratitude and love for you, and the contentment of knowing that I was right all along (as usual…)
